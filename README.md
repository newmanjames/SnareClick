## What I've Learned
- Building a REST API with Java and Spring Boot.
- Structuring a Spring Boot project with models, services, repositories, controllers, and data transfer objects (DTOs).
- What Object Relationship Mapping (ORM) is and why it's useful.
- Managing a PostgreSQL database with Spring Data JPA.
- Handling REST API requests between frontend and backend.
- Creating a simple web interface with React.
- Deploying the application to a virtual private server (VPS).
- Configuring NGINX as a reverse proxy for my frontend and backend.
- Configuring DNS records for a domain name.

- Implement Docker to improve efficiency of deployment and dependency management.
- Configure thorough logging to improve debugging efficiency.
- Write unit tests and integration tests for my application.
